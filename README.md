What is it?
-----------

An addon for WoW Classic that allow you to put out talent points and apply them, 
one by one, in order to avoid mis-clicking Dagger Mastery when what you wanted was Riposte
(shoutout to Pitchfork and the gang at Mirage Raceway!).


Will it sell all my items and send the money to your underground network of Swiss Gnomes?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, but that is an intriguing idea.


Can I configure it somehow?
---------------------------

Yes, but only by editing the lua file directly. 
At the top there are some options to change if you feel like it.


What is planned for this addon?
-------------------------------

Not much at the moment, it will be kept up to date until I release TalentPlanner which 
will do what this does.... AND MORE. But mostly stuff with talents.


How do I contact you?

Try removing any ala from the following name and send a message wowinterface.com:

I hope you enjoy this addon.
